# PDF Rule Checker – Fullstack Assignment

This is a small fullstack project where the user uploads a PDF and enters 3 rules.  
The backend checks the document against those rules using an LLM and returns:

- pass/fail
- short evidence sentence
- your reasoning
- confidence (0–100)

The goal was to keep things simple and readable.
